This is a bonded support to avoid the drilling onto the steering column. The support can be bonded with double sided tape. 
This still needs testing, so print at your own risk. 

Material tested on the pictures is Nylon PA12. I recommend using a good quality / gel type double sided tape if you use PA materials.
